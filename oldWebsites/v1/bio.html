			Hi, I'm Colan Bimer a computer science major with a focus on game design at Drexel University. I want to make games 
			and learn as much as I possibly can in the process. I'm currently working with Frank Lee and the rest of the 
			<a href="http://egs.excite.drexel.edu/" target="_blank" style="display:inline" id="spacing"> 
				EGS
			</a> 
			studio. I have one app on the app store called "Game 1ne" and I was the lead programmer on the "Worlds Largest Game of Tetris" proejct which currently has the guiness world record for Worlds Largest Architectual Video Game. I'm currently working on the follow up and a new app "Rock, Paper, Scissors: The Baord Game" which are described in the proejcts page. Couple notes: if you click on the buttons on the side of the home page you will be able to play tic-tac-toe or pong, depending on which one you click. Both of these feature an AI that can in fact be beaten, the coding for the games is super ugly though. Clicking on "Colan Biemer" will let you play snake. I intend to add pictures to the project portion of the website soon and update this section.

			I've also completed a coursera course: Online Games: Literature, New Media, and Narrative and General Game Playing.
